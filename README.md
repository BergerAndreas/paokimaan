# SquadTeam45

### Run the app with easymode

This will use a database from mlab instead of local database where you have to use mongodb and pokescraper, making life much easier for you <3  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT2810/it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-squadteam-45.git
cd it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-squadteam-45
npm i
npm run easy
```


### Run the app w/ local DB

Install  [mongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

To run the app, clone the repository to a desired location, navigate to the root, install requirements, and run the app as such:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT2810/it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-squadteam-45.git
cd it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-squadteam-45
npm i
npm run dev
```

To import data about pokemon into local mongoDB 

``` bash
cd pokescraper
mongoimport --jsonArray --db pokemon --collection pokeweebs --file pokemon.json
```
**PS.** Dette kan være et hælvete. Det er letter å kjøre: "npm run easy" for å kjøre med en database fra AWS ;)

The app runs on localhost:4200

The api runs on localhost:3000/api

## Tests

### Run backend tests

To run the tests, navigate to the root folder, and run the following:
```bash
npm run testbe
```

Resoults in (as of 22.11.17):

```bash

### Run frontend tests

To run the tests do: 
```bash
ng test --sourcemap=false
```

To check test coverage do:
```bash
ng test --single-run --code-coverage --sourcemap=false
```

This should create a coverage folder inside the client directory 
```bash
cd coverage
```

Then open the `index.html` file. This will result to this picture:
